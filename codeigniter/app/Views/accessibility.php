            <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
            <div class="m-5"></div>
            <p>Our website, <span class="fw-bold">"Web Store"</span>, is committed to providing a 
            website accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their ability or technology.
            </p>
            <div class="m-4"></div>
            <p>
                We endeavour to eventually conform to level AA of the 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>. 
                As of now, most attention was put into following the 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML" target="_blank">base suggestions provided by the MDN Web Docs</a> with concern to accessibility. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">The aim of conforming to these guidelines is to make the web more user friendly for all kinds of people.</p>
            <div class="m-4"></div>
            <p>Our site has been built using code compliant with recent HTML5 and CSS standards and best practices. The site displays 
                correctly in current browsers as of 27/08/2022, and its use of standards for HTML/CSS will further ensure any future 
                browsers or versions will display it correctly, too.</p>

            <h3>Known Exceptions</h3>
            <div class="m-4"></div>

            <p>Whilst we aim to adhere to as many accepted guidelines, standards and best practices for accessibility and usability, 
                it is not always possible to do so in all areas of our website.</p>
            <div class="m-4"></div>
            <h6>Exceptions Include</h6>
            
            <ul>
                <li class="my-2">Not being able to provide detailed image or media descriptions on user-generated content. This may result in lack of screen-reader accessible descriptions for some products if users do not provide their own descriptions.</li>
                <li class="my-2">Some features are provided using dynamic Javascript scripting technology combined with mouse-based 
                    click interactions. Not all such features may be supported by screen readers and tab-based navigation fully.</li>
                <li class="my-2">While we will provide a direct link to video files uploaded by users, we have been unable to provide 
                    alternative file formats.</li>
                <li class="my-2">We cannot guarantee user generated HTML content follows best practices for screen reader interpretation.</li>
            </ul>
